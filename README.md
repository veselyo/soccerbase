# Soccerbase
## Description
In this project, we attempted to create a full-stack mock soccer betting platform. It integrates real-time data via an API (https://www.api-football.com/) about the 5 European primary leagues and the 2022 World Cup. It streams betting for the 2022 World Cup via simulated transactions, allowing users to deposit fake currency and use it for bets, which are dynamically paid out based on the result.

## Features
- Firstly, the website starts at the home page. This consists of a bootstrap navigation bar which has Home, Leagues, World Cup 2022, Register, Login, Account, and Log Out.
- Home redirects you to the home page with no login required.
- Leagues contains the Big Five European Soccer Leagues and displays their standings. There is the table of the league which shows the position of each team. Then, there are the actual matches that have been played last round and are coming up next round.
- World Cup 2022 contains the standings of the World Cup where positions of each country are shown within their respective group.
- Register allows the user to register into the system by inputting their username and password twice.
- Login allows the user to log into their account that they created in register.
- Account lets the user view information related to the bets they have placed: status, match, your bet team, amount, odds, time, and your balance.
- Log out lets the user log out of their account.

## Demo
